# SOLAR-BATTERY-CHARGER
As there is an ongoing renewable power deficiency problem, our projects aims to give solution by providing a reliable source and a method to charge a few daily must need devices of 12V DC rating . Which can then be used directly or boosted to operate other necessary systems(Higher Rating Or Lower Rating). Our main goal is to power a 12V DC operated power devices which we will demonstrated by charging a 12V battery. As solar is the most reliable renewable source, we are limiting our input range to a voltage range around 4V to 6V that which is obtained by general portable solar cells. We are aiming to make our project as a small scale version of solar energy harvest, so that it is portable and cost friendly.
